TITLE,REVIEW
['My all time favorite camera!'],"['I paired my 6D with a Sigma art 35mm and 85mm. After two years of owning this camera and using it almost every day for my photography business I feel like I need to leave a review to guide anyone looking for a reliable camera for their photography business. I specialized in Pet photography and also do a lot of family sessions and the live mode touch screen in addition to single point focus was ESSENTIAL for my pet photos! It was a total game changer! I was able to quickly and easily focus on the eyes with just tapping on the screen! I have tried upgrading to different cameras and ALWAYS come back to my 6D Mii. The colors are amazing and does everything I need it to! The one thing I wish was better it’s ability in low light. I am a natural light/outdoor photographer so I rarely needed it in low light situations, but when I did it didn’t really perform as well as I had hoped. It was definitely a lot better that my old Canon Rebel which was a crop sensor. If you are on the fence about buying this camera I highly recommend it! It is my all time favorite camera especially for the price! I call it Ole reliable because it never lets me down!']"
['Very nice camera'],"['Between the 6D Mark II and the 80D I chose to go Full Frame. For $1800 after tax I got the camera and the STM 24-105 Lens. And have been learning AP mode and manual mode (the dog pictures I uploaded are in manual) and I am getting much better results than auto mode. The auto focus is great and use it more than manual focus. Image quality is great, comparing it to budget DSLR\'s like the Rebel it is a night and day difference. The STM isn\'t mentioned much in reviews, It is good for an all around lens, but I will certainly get a nicer lens for detailed portraits, It isn\'t very sharp when zoomed past 50 but I don\'t have the $ for a high end lens right now. After uploading the pictures on photoshop or light room I noticed the colors seem a little ""washed out"" which I read in several pro reviews so it isn\'t just me. But the image quality is just amazing, I can\'t put this camera down and can\'t wait to take it out on weekends. I would use this camera for anything from weddings to portraits, street photography, landscapes, what ever you desire. With the 40,000 iso you can take some great pictures in low light, it DOES NOT have a flash, you must buy an external flash for it, however you are not going to have awful results without one like you would with a budget crop sensor. It does not have 4k video, but I need it for photography not video. Yet a brand new iphone or Galaxy won\'t touch the 1080p video the 6d mark II puts out. DOES NOT COME WITH A USB CORD, the wireless connect is a headache so I ordered a usb cord and do it the old fashion way. The bluetooth is neat for viewing images on your phone instead of looking at a smaller 3"" screen. The 6D Mark II does what I need it to, buya nice lens for it, stay out of auto mode and you have a professional camera no if ands or buts.']"
['Great Overall Camera In Low Light'],"['I upgraded two weeks ago, from a Canon 70D to the 6D Mk II and could not be happier. The AF in low light along with the superb full frame CMOS sensor delivers a noticeable enough difference in image quality and depth to justify the purchase. This was my first venture into the full frame line up and it has allowed me to be much more creative in low light close quarters without seeing any real noise. The only drawback for me is the 6.5 fps as I do a lot of fast action, thus, a slightly slimmer chance of framing the ""perfect"" shot. Perfectly accepted as a tradeoff. I am anxious to try out the 4K video time lapse feature. I have attached two pictures that were taken at night in normal room low lighting. Details are on the pictures.']"
"['All I can say is, ""Wow!""']","[""I just received my 6D II yesterday. I am impressed, to say the least. However, when I saw the thickness of the owner's manual I almost had heart failure! It's over an inch thick! But...it's in three languages so that explained a lot. *Whew* I immediately charged the battery and took some test shots. Totally impressed. The experts may not be too crazy about the 6D II but I am! I upgraded from my trusty 40D and I am not sorry I did. I use two L series lenses: 24-70 f/2.8 and a 70-200 f/2.8. The 6D II will make those lenses shine even more. The attached images were taken with the 6D II with the Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 L lens-hand held with only available lighting. Aperture priority setting and auto ISO. RAW converted to .jpg with Photoshop Lightroom. TAKE NOTE!: RAW images taken with cameras manufactured after 12/2017 are no longer compatible with most older Apps and/or programs. My LR 4.0 could not read the RAW images taken by the 6D II. You will/may need to upgrade. I had to forsake my trusty LR 4.0 and became a paying member of Adobe's Creative Cloud family. I chose to download just Lightroom. $9.99/month plus applicable taxes. There are some work-arounds but I chose to simply upgrade. For some, not having 4K video may be an issue. Did not matter to me as I seldom use video. This WILL be a great upgrade to an enthusiast's full-frame. I still have lots to read and learn about the 6D II so I just may be adding to this review. Enjoy!!""]"
['Huge Upgrade From Where I Was.'],"['I upgraded from the 70D, which was an excellent camera, to my first full frame and the results are amazing. It handles the low light / high iso noise incredibly well. Both of the pictures below were shot with the Canon 6D Mk II and a Canon 70-200mm f2.8L using only dim room lighting. No flash. Judge for yourself. I am very impressed and pleased with my purchase. I could not pull these off with the 70D.']"
['Great full frame camera with excellent color'],"[""After about 1100 images, I have found the Canon 6D mkII to be very capable and quiet for a fast shutter camera. The 2 things I don't like about it is the lack of exposure control when shooting in HSS mode and the lack of a flash sync. Other than that, It is easy to use and captures colors and fine detail all of the clarity your lens will allow.""]"
['Excellent upgrade from crop sensor'],"['I got this as an upgrade from the Canon T7i. I wanted to try a full frame camera. I am very happy with the upgraded image quality. It is definitely not a drastic difference, However it is noticable to me. I am very pleased with the purchase and am having a great time using it.']"
['Most amazing camera'],"['I’m so in love with this camera and it’s the best full frame camera purchase, I love it and I love my pictures and how amazingly beautiful it comes out']"
['Great Upgrade To a Full Frame'],"[""This is my first Full Frame Camera. I upgraded from a Canon 77D to this and so far I haven't found anything I don't like about it.""]"
['Most Technically Advanced Camera To Date!'],"[""Incredible performance from this work of art & I'm pleased to own one!""]"
"[""If You Liked The 6D, You'll Love The 6D Mark II""]","[""I've been a Canon shooter for many years and have had many Canon bodies including the original 6D. The 6D Mark II is clearly a worthy upgrade over the 6D. I've read many so-so reviews on the Mark II, but I think many of these reviewers have unrealistic expectations. The Mark II is an entry level full-frame camera, but has many very worthwhile features for the enthusiast. I've had the Mark II about a month and the still photos that I've taken are stunning. It's a fun camera that is capable of producing great results. If you need a 4K video and/or dual card slots then the 6D Mark II is not for you. I also have a 5D Mark III and 7D Mark II and I can say that the image quality is as good as or better than either of those bodies.""]"
['Best Pro-Am Camera body'],"['I still own the previous version of this camera body. At the time it was a HUGE step up from my aging crop-sensor 50D. Full frame brought me back to my 35mm roots and I\'m loving it. Canon made a number of improvements on this second version of the 6D. For starters, Auto focus points.... MUCH more on this camera. Is it more than the 5D MK IV? No, but still it has (45) of them and they are cross-type. I would have preferred that they were not so clustered together, and that Canon would have spread them out more over the viewing area, but still a huge much needed and welcome step up. There is a considerable bump in image size from 20.6 to 26.2 but nothing to get overly excited about there. There are complaints from a lot of pro reviewers and and tech outlets that the 6D Mk II has a very limited dynamic range. Well, if it does I am not seeing it. I put the camera to the test with some low key lighting setups right out of the gate, and it has not disappointed me yet. There are a couple of sample images attached for review. So, unless you are shooting in some horrendous conditions and you don\'t know how to compensate, I really don\'t think Dynamic range should be too much of a concern. I was also wanting more FPS (frames per second), and this MkII doubles that compared to the 6D. Up from 3 FPS to 6.5 FPS. So great improvement there. Lots of complaints and hemming and hawing about the lack of 4k video capability on this camera as well..... BIG DEAL! Its made to be a feature limited full frame pro-am camera anyways... what did you expect? On the plus side Canon did give us auto focus tracking on the Mk II which they did not have on the 6D Mk I. So when you do decide to shoot some video the auto focus automatically tracks your subject without you having to manually refocus all the time. The flip out screen I was on the fence about, but I like it for a couple of reasons. One, you can flip it over when the camera isn\'t in use to protect the screen from getting all scratched up. Two, it\'s kinda handy when shooting at extremely awkward angles. The touch screen I don\'t really care for. I could do without it, but it is nice to be able to jump to a completely different part of the in camera menu without having to scroll through all of the headers to get where you want. There are a couple of the things that are annoying me at present. I can\'t get this camera to auto rotate my images. I don\'t mind turning the camera to the side to see my portrait images full screen. I just wish it would do that itself. My bigger issue is Canon felt the need to over complicate HSS (High Speed Sync) on this camera body. It should just work. I use HSS capable off camera studio strobes, but the HSS feature doesn\'t work for some reason. It works fine on my original 6D MK I, but on the Mk II I need to setup HSS on the in camera menu, and I keep getting an error message saying that my flash is not compatible even though it is listed as a compatible device. So maybe an update on that later. In closing, this camera is a beast of an upgrade if you are coming from a 6D MK I or lower. If you are contemplating spending some extra cheddar on the 5D MK IV, consider the following.... All you are really getting for that $1600 is 4k video capability, 20 more auto focus point that are more spread out, slightly better dynamic range, 1.5 FPS faster continuous shooting, and a small resolution bump. If that\'s worth $1600.00 then go for that big rig and tear it up, but if not this camera is definitely suited for professional and by no means should be considered and ""entry level camera for beginners"".']"
['Great full-frame DSLR!'],"['This is a phenomenal full-frame DSLR at a great price. I made the switch from Canon Rebel XT so I was in for a shock! This camera performs really well under all lighting conditions. Using auto ISO settings and have not needed any flashes up to now. Paired with my 24-105 Canon IS lens and it performs beautifully. I have had the camera for 5 months and have taken several indoor and outdoor photos. The image quality is stunning, auto focus is on the spot and fast. I also love the fact that I can transfer photos to my phone on the fly and post them online. The camera feels well in my hand. Definitely recommend it to a serious amateur photographer if considering an upgrade.']"
['Best upgraded body'],['First of all I am very impressed with this camera body. The LCD screen is amazing and the capability and a user friendliness with the LCD screen and also going from the viewfinder to looking at your LCD screen is a very nice option it really helps new photographers figure out their camera and figure out how to take the best pictures you to utilizing the best camera settings. I love this camera body so much that I purchased two additional ones I gave one to my sister and one to my husband and we decided we were going to become a photography team which we are enjoying so much it is almost life-changing for us']
['Best Daily Driver From Canon'],"[""As a professional photographer for over 13 years, the 6D MkII is in my opinion the best daily driver from Canon. It is built well, performs does everything just as a full-frame should, and won't break the bank. The video is great, especially with a gimbal. Because of its price point, it makes it a great buy for someone looking to go full-frame or student in a photo program. In my opinion, this is the best and most affordable option if a 5D MkIV is out of your price range. Buy this and spend the money you saved to buy that nice lens you've been eyeing instead of a 5D MkIV, unless money is not a question.""]"
['Very nice price for a full frame!'],"[""I shot with this camera for close to 2 years as an amateur landscape photographer. Coming from the 80D, this was a nice upgrade and very fitting for my 1st full frame DSLR. I learned so much on this camera because it gave me room enough to challenge myself in it's capabilities and grow as a photographer. My one and only complaint was that the fastest shutter speed was 1/4000 of a sec. I prefer 1/8000 of a sec. That's a minor thing to some and that alone doesn't deter most to steer away from buying it. For the price and the fact that it is a full frame makes it more than worth it. So, if you're an amateur that has a lot of room for growth, I say go for it because you will learn so much!""]"
['Great camera at a good price'],"[""I love photography and everything about it.. I started off with the basic rebel like most people when they first pick up photography. Then over time I worked my way up through a handful of bodies until I got the full frame Canon 6D which was great, but lacked some functions that the 5DIV had. I was looking at getting a 5D Mark IV, but when I saw the 6D Mark II with functions that were closer to the 5D and at a much lower cost I had to make the purchase. Im sure I would have enjoyed the 5D Mark IV more, but with the money I saved I just ended up getting more L lenses. I mean who doesn't want more glass? So.. great image quality, good amount of functionality and all at a great price!""]"
['Great video camera'],"[""As an owner of the original 6D I was happy when the Mark ii was announced. After getting many bad reviews, I decided to buy it anyway. Turns out I was right, the Mark ii is the way to go. Flippie screen is awesome and a game changer. The dual CMOS auto focus works extremely well, making this one of the best DSLRs for vlogging. Buy it! You won't regret it.""]"
"['Excellent ""Entry"" Full-frame']","[""I don't personally do a lot of video shooting hence the Full HD non-4K feature isn't a con for me. Pros: affordable, beautiful, lightweight, fit for amateurs and pros alike. Cons: I'd like Canon to maybe provide a camera bag with the body at least for protection since it's not fully waterproof or dust proof. Just an idea.""]"
['Very nice camera'],"[""I bought this to replace my 6D mk I, good choice, this camera is fantastic! I use it for astrophotography and landscape photography, the 6d mk II excels in all categories! Not a good choice for video though with it's 1080.""]"
['Canon - EOS 6D Mark II DSLR Video Camera'],"[""I can't say anything more about this product, only that's just what I needed, excellent quality and functionality.""]"
['Absolutely love it'],"['The best camera I have ever used, I was able to switch my photography partner over to Canon']"
['Great camera.'],['Absolutely love this camera. My very first full frame. My best camera purchase']
['Excellent camera for the price!'],['Excellent camera for the price. Takes great photos in low light.']
['Go to camera'],['Great full frame sensor work well with my 600mm lens.']
['Good Camera'],"[""Recently bought it and I like it. I like the way it fits in my hand and the grip that it offers. Didn't have to use the strap at all. Love the tilt screen. Misses the autofocus a little during high burst mode but catches up. Haven't tested the low dynamic range that it offers at lower ISO yet. Overall, I like the camera but it could have been much better if the 45 cross points were wide spread. I have had issues with composition due to that. I also didn't like the joystick. Would have loved to have the joystick on 5D Mark IV and dual card slots.""]"
"['Bad experience, 16 days into using the camera!']","['The camera is nice, but have bugs, on live view, if using lens correction data ""ON"", the camera frozen and give you an ""Error code 70"". You have to turn the camera off and take the battery out to restart the camera. This happens for 3rd party lenses, but still a bug. If you switch all lens correction data to ""OFF"" on the camera, the error stop showing, this issue happens to other canon cameras with 3rd party lenses, and problems with memory cards or batteries. Upset this happened 16 days after buying the camera, can\'t exchange it anymore!']"
['Great camera for beginners'],"['I upgraded from a T1i. I was debating between the Canon 80D and the Canon 6D Mark ii. I was hesitant thinking maybe it was too soon for me to upgrade to a full frame camera and had already set my mind on the Canon 80D. After weeks of research, I found a video on the 6D Mark ii that fully convinced me to go with it. The settings on the 6D Mark ii is convienent for beginners like me who has very basic knowledge in photography. I love the easy access focus feature, ISO, and shooting mode on this camera. It’s fast and easy to customize a setting that fits my need when I’m taking pictures. I believe the features and settings were way easier to adjust compare to my T1i. This camera fit my needs and lifestyle. It was well worth the investment and purchase for me.']"
['Image quality is sub-par'],"[""Let's start with the positives. This camera is light, strong, has an amazing touch screen and decent size OVF. The DPAF in video is great, as well has above average battery life. The negative however, is a much longer list. The dynamic range in RAW files is a joke and comparable to APS-C cameras from 10 years ago. The High ISO is unusable past 3200. The video recording options are handicapped by poor codec. There is no headphone jack. The AF is not fast. The worst part, the original 6D still has better image quality.""]"
['Excellent Full Frame Camera'],"[""I bought this camera about a month ago because I was finally ready to take the step up to full frame from cropped sensor and I think this camera is amazing. The 6d Mark II offers so many features for the price that I honestly haven't seen another better Canon full frame that also has the articulating screen. With this camera, you're getting 26 megapixels, 1080 at up to 60fps, in body stabilization, up to 7 frames per second, a full frame sensor, and of course that flip out screen. If you're on the fence, I'd say go for it.""]"
['Great camera crappy canon software.'],['It’s so stupid that that canon decided to not make their RAW files compatible with image editing software unless you download their own software for reading RAW images. Totally disrupts workflow. There was no reason for it. The camera itself gets 4.5 of 5 stars but their RAW file software gets 2 of 5 stars. Taking a ton of RAW files is a pain in the butt now. I don’t know if Nikon or Sony are doing the same thing but if not I would consider that you look into a Nikon instead. It’s a shame because it’s a really good camera.']
['Great Full Frame DSLR for a Great Price'],"[""This a great DSLR with a full frame high megapixel sensor and touch display. The touch display makes changing the camera's setting as easy as possible, and has descriptions of the settings if you cannot remember all of them. The camera also has live view and shoots 1080p video. The camera takes beautiful images. Only drawback is the camera does not have a built-in flash, but high ISO options negate this loss. Overall a fantastic camera for the price and has a number of features not on any other Canon cameras yet.""]"
"[""Lives up to it's reputation""]","[""I bought the 6DMarkII to upgrade from a 70D that I still use as a backup. I decided I wanted to stay in the EOS line because of lens investments, but also because of the SLR viewfinder for nature photos. I read that the focusing was faster and it was the first full frame sensor I've used. So far, I'm not disappointed in the investment. It is familiar enough to the 70D to make an easy transition, but has enough updates to make it worth the investment. Will be sorry to see the SLR's disappear as time moves on.""]"
['6D Mark ii'],"[""This is a great camera. I upgraded to the 6d MkII as I needed a second full frame body, but had a budget to stay within. I started doing a lot more video so the flippy out articulating screen was a factor. Very useful for composing shots. Do I need 4K? No. All of the video I shoot for clients are all for the web, so 4K isn't an issue. The only issue I have is no 120fps @ 1080. That 120fps @ 1080 would have been that fifth star. Other than that, I am very happy with my 6D MkII.""]"
['Most versatile full frame camera'],"[""I was skeptical at first due to all the commotion about DR prior to the release. DR is somewhat debatable only when you are shooting at low 100-200 ISO. But who really shoots in the 100's? You're only going to shoot in the lowest ISO at 100 on sunny days. Heck, your iPhone can take excellent shots thx to the natural sunlight. Once you get past the 200 ISO, 6Dmk2 is on the same par as the 5D's. This camera takes excellent shots in the low lights/indoor.""]"
['Nice full frame cam for beginners'],['I use to shoot all my work on a canon rebel. For shooters we know it’s not full frame so I jumped to this immediately after renting it a few times. The quality is great. Def heavier than a rebel. Works awesome. Only flaw is the autofocus. It doesn’t have as many points as other cameras. So if it’s not in a certain frame your SOL. Other than that I’ve learned to work with it until I can level up to a better full frame! (5D family)']
['Great For a First time Full Frame'],"[""Picked this up so I'd have a second body for vlogging and taking some pics. Wanted to get the full potential out of my EF lenses and that's what I got. Biggest selling points for me were dual pixel auto-focus, 4k/1080p in camera timelapse and it being the only full frame with a flip out screen. I felt I could lose out on the ability to shoot 4K because not many people have devices that they can watch 4K content in anyways.""]"
['A really good camera'],"[""There is a lot of yeah being talked on this camera, but if you are invested in the Canon system, this will get good results and is a really easy to use camera. The menus are well laid out and you can make custom menus to get to what you want quickly. It's got awesome timelapse features. I've shot about 2000 images so far and I've really enjoyed this camera. It's never gets in its own way and let's you just take photos.""]"
['Incredible quality for the price.'],"['My wife has been doing photography for quite a few years on her old Rebel T1, she was extremely excited to have received this for her birthday. This camera has dramatically increased the initial quality of her photographs by the widest of margins. This is her second choice next to the 5D. This is an extremely versatile, quality and awesome camera to have at your disposal.']"
['Defective AUto focus'],['The camera would not focus properly I’ve seen great results from this camera but mine just would not focus. I returned it and was charged a restocking fee so I couldn’t even order a replacement. I was told I would have the restocking fee waived when I returned it. Then after the fee wasn’t waived I was told it would be refunded it’s been 2 weeks that hasn’t happened yet.']
['Awesome Camera with lots of capability.'],['Overall this camera has a lot of functionality and one thing I like the most is that you can change most items on the touch screen instead of several various dials to make adjustments. It makes it much quicker and easier to make these adjustments on the fly. So far have not found anything I would say needs changing but I am a beginner so take that into consideration.']
['Canon EOS 6D Mark ii'],['Best purchase I have ever done. Had to save for months and thought about it for too long. Did some research on the camera and I am loving it! Specially the Bluetooth feature where I can send pictures to my smartphone directly!! Great for immediate social media post!! I highly recommend read the manual before you use it. It will make it way easier to figure it out.']
['Excellent camera for experienced shooters'],"['The 6d mark ii is a great buy. It has many features of a higher end dslr at a lower cost. There are a few minor trade offs when purchasing the 6d mark ii vs say a 5d mark iv, but for most people those minor trade offs will be worth the extra savings. My favorite feature is the rotating LCD screen which makes it easier to line up and take photos in tight spots.']"
"['Poor image quality, deal breaker.']",['Owned the 6d for a long time and was quite happy with it. Waited for the successor and waited and waited... Finally gave in and bought a D750 and it was an incredible upgrade all the way around. When the 6d2 was available pre order I sold the d750. I like Cannon and was expecting at least it to match the IQ but I returned it for the loss on restocking fee.']
['Canon lover'],"[""Started with Rebel 2T, then a 60D. Just bought this camera & haven't used yet. Noticed controls are different from my 60D, instruction manual small, so ordered a nice big book from Amazon to tell me detailed instructions about this wonderful new camera. Have been waiting for full frame cameras to be affordable for hobbyists and now they are!""]"
['Bestbuy/Canon Committed'],"[""After a month of looking at all the alternatives, I decided to stay with Canon and also with the DSLR even though some reviews had it on the edge of the ledge... it doesn't have a few capabilities like 4k video, shutter sound, and so on... I have several Canon lenses that I wanted to keep active... the video is not as important to me... and I have a dedicated Sony video set-up if I want to go there. I was impressed with the discussions I had at Bestbuy and have been a customer there for many years... recently Bb refunded an HP laptop that had died because I am a Bb subscriber and Cc holder... their service helped, even though alternatives are also there. I did lose a good lens that is not compatible... will use it on the old Rebel going forward as a backup. I also like the Canon Photo education... Bestbuy also has a good group of techs who helped me with the printer decision... I did go Epson Expression Photo HD XP 15000... my first non HP printer!""]"
['Great for Professional Photographers'],['My son Is a starting a career as a professional photographer. He used to own a canon rebel and he has can’t stop talking about how Great this new camera is. It’s a full frame camera with a great auto focus and face tracking. He’s been doing much more photo shoots since he’s had it and can’t help to believe the camera is upping his game']
['Difficulty With Wifi Connection'],"[""I was looking forward to the wifi feature, but to my disappointment, it's been very difficult trying to get the camera to pair or connect with my iPhone 5. I was able to do it two times and that was it. This is still a good camera as many of the reviews have already mentioned. Just wish wifi connection would actually work every time.""]"
['love it !'],['I hadn’t purchased a new camera since my canon 30D and decided to splurge on this camera. I love all the features it has on it especially since I can transfer the images right away to my phone via Bluetooth. It makes it super convenient when I want to preview a few images for clients right away if I don’t have my laptop available.']
['Great camera'],"['So far, I love this camera. It is great in low light and is just easy to handle over all. The AF is a little unimpressive when in manual mode, but works better in other modes. I wish the pre set focal points spanned across the entire image. But other than those thing, the camera is exactly what I would want in my first full frame.']"
['Great Full Fram Sensor for the Money'],"[""Canon 6D MkII excellent full frame buy for the passionate enthusiast looking to move up to a semi-pro camera. Although average (behind the industry ) for video - no 4k, just full HD - this camera offers a full feature set: 26mp, great battery life, superfast autofocus, Canon's Digic 7 sensor, and great low-light performance.""]"
['Great upgrade!'],"[""I'm so happy with my purchase. I already had the 6D and this was an upgrade, to make my old 6D a backup. I love the Canon brands and the flip out screen is exactly what I was missing with the older 6D version from my Rebels. This is a great body if you can't afford to go higher but still need a great low light body!""]"
['Awesome upgrade for a first full-frame'],"[""I am so impressed with this new model. My only warning is to anyone using the stand-alone copy of Lightroom... the RAW files are not compatible so you have to convert to DNG for Lightroom to recognize it and you can't download any updates for it to work either. You can still use your RAWs, it's just an extra step.""]"
['Great Camera'],"[""This is definitely an upgrade from my 5D Mark II. Would love to have 4K video, but needed the camera for photography. Autofocus works great and the WiFi also maintains a constant connection when transferring files. At this time, you can't upload the RAW files into Lightroom, but I think Adobe is working on a fix.""]"
['Big Step up from my 70D'],"['I love Canon cameras for shooting photos, not so much videos though. I recently upgraded to the 6D MKII from the 70D and instantly noticed a faster Auto Focus, better color range, and just more options to shoot how I want to shoot. I mostly do product photography and this has made the work flow a lot easier.']"
['Great for traveling and amateur photography'],"[""I'm not a pro, at all. I do know about cameras and how to operate them, and this camera has everything I need to capture pretty memorable moments. I do recommend carrying a few extra batteries, getting a nice 50mm and getting a good quality strap. It's on the heavy side, but don't all DSLRs super heavey?""]"
['Love the 6D Mark II'],"['I previously owned the Rebel t6 and wanted to upgrade to the 5D Mark IV But didn’t want to spend that much yet, maybe in a few years. So after comparing several other options I wen with the 6D Mark II and I am so happy with it so far! I will definitely keep it for a second camera when I do upgrade again!']"
['perfect full-frame upgrade from a crop-sensor !!'],"['This is a great full-frame camera to start out with or upgrade to. I recently upgraded to this camera from a crop sensor, and I love it!!! I definitely would recommend this camera to anyone who doesn’t want to spend as much as the Canon 5d Mark IV but still wants to invest in a full-frame camera.']"
['Great full frame'],"['For the experienced enthusiast or for a pro looking for a good full frame without breaking the bank this is a great choice. This camera received a lot of bad press, but most of it is not really relevant to most users. If you must have full 4K video, then this is not your camera. If you need more that 30mp then this is not your camera. If you need unlimited focus points that cover the entire viewfinder this is not your camera. But if you want reasonably priced full frame with excellent performance, great features, amazing dual pixel live view focus, and great overall performance then you need to look at this camera. Some say it has poor dynamic range, but I donâ\x80\x99t find that to be a practical reality (itâ\x80\x99s a pixel peeping lab result, not real application). At low ISO expose slightly to the right and youâ\x80\x99ll be thrilled with the results. Only downside for me is the single card slot which makes me nervous when doing client work. Other than that one issue I definitely recommend the 6D mkII.']"
['Great camera. Full frame'],"['I love this camera, although some people are switching to mirrorless. I want to invest in a second one just when doing weddings so I will not take up too much time in swapping out the lenses. Love the swivel LCD screen.

['Buy it!'],"['Seriously the best DSLR camera I’ve ever bought. I have a rebel SL3 and use that really for day to day photos. The mark 6D I use more for photoshoots and definitely worth the price for me. Easy to use, heavy but easy to hold in hand comfortably, and produces quality photos.']"

['Great improvements to an already great camera!'],"['Great update to an already great camera! Don’t be taken by some reviews that say there isn’t much to this update. First, it’s still the great body the original was … is. It feels good in the hands. Substantial. There are a few features that users will benefit from immediately. Better autofocus, touch screen focus, articulating screen, live view when shooting and much better autofocus during, and Bluetooth. Under the hood your have an updated chip, 26mp instead of 20, improved video, and better battery life. If you do your own editing, as I do, you’ll see these improvements on your computer screen. “But there’s no 4k!” First, the average hobbyist doesn’t need 4k. You likely don’t have a 4k capable tv. Also, working with 4k in an editing system can be slow and frustrating. Even if you work in video you’re better off using a video camera, not a dslr. Though I understand the appeal due to coat needs the full sized sensor. Still, considering many things are winding up online, 1080 … good 1080 is beyond good enough. If you have the 6D, this is a great upgrade. If you want to move to a better camera with a full size sensor without breaking the bank, this is the perfect camera.']"
